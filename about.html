                  <p>
                    Hi! I'm Shaqib Habib, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout my two years in the tech industry working in
                    event planning, community operations, and web development, I
                    have developed a passion for project management and
                    problem-solving, leading me to pursue a career in full-stack
                    web development. I am committed to developing and creating
                    strategic projects and enjoy exploring new ideas and
                    programming languages. Having worked in a wide variety of
                    environments, I’ve shown initiative and functioned
                    cross-collaboratively to successfully achieve project goals
                    while remaining calm under high-pressure deadlines and
                    urgent client requests. Thorough attention to detail is
                    crucial in identifying and analyzing to break down the big
                    picture vision into manageable steps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently, my goal is to work as a web developer for an
                    organization I’m passionate about in an environment that
                    fosters growth, development, and encourages creative
                    freedom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I wasn't always a computer programmer. After graduating from
                    Indiana University, Bloomington in 2012, I set my hearts out
                    to work in the entertainment industry. I started out as an
                    intern for an managment company and another at an agency.
                    Though two sides of the same coin, I delt with managing the
                    actors and scheduling their daily meetings with my boss or
                    assisting with submitting talent for potential film,
                    television, or commerical roles. Even though I was enjoying
                    the work lifestyle, I believe I needed something more in
                    life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After a year interning, I took a break to travel the world
                    and learned to become more independent. Along my journey, I
                    discoved skills I needed to tap into more. I was networking,
                    communicating with different types of people from all
                    different religions and lifestyles, and learned to enjoy
                    life rather than worrying about what others had to say about
                    me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With two more years of growth, I grew a thickskin and headed
                    back to Los Angeles. For the past five years, I've grown
                    more as an individual. I've helped build communities, worked
                    in the entertainment industry meeting celebrities and making
                    people happy, and learned that a career makes the person
                    they are if they put their mind to it.
